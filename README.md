[Description]
- Creation of a neural network is carried out step by step to classify whether or not a user bought a particular product, without the need for specialized AI libraries.<br>
- First, a class called "NeuralNetwork" will be defined in charge of carrying out all the relevant processes in training, adjustment, label prediction and performance evaluation metrics of the network, based on the architecture that is specified for the desired network, that is That is, the number of layers and neurons in each one.
- After the network architecture will be configured, defining the number of layers and neurons in each of the layers with the intention of obtaining the best classification performance.
- Finally, the learning rate and the number of epochs that the network will use for training will be specified, obtaining its performance based on the mean square error in its predictions.<br>
